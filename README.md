# MousePlayback
MousePlayback is an Windows Forms application that records your mouse- and keyboard clicks/movements after you press record, and plays them back when you press play.

You can use the buttons for this, or hotkeys. Default:

* F1: Start and stop recording
* F2: Start and stop playing back the recording
