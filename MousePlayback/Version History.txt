V1.0.0 - Initial release

V1.0.1
Fixed an issue where exporting a playback didn't work

V1.0.2
You can now move the mouse during playback when the mouse wasn't being moved during that part of the recording(for example if you are typing and not moving the mouse)
previously it would hold the mouse on the location you left it at while typing
